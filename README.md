Project 1: Campus Recruitment Fairness Audit 🏹🛡️
Business Task: Identify if recruitment outcomes are influenced by gender or degree specialization rather than academic performance alone.

Definitions Applied:

Fairness: Analyzing if the placement process provides equal opportunity regardless of gender.

Attributes: Using gender, degree_t, and ssc_p to categorize student data.

Oversampling (Concept): I identified that if one gender is significantly underrepresented, we would need to oversample to ensure a balanced analysis.

Tools Used: > * Google Sheets (for data cleaning and pivot tables).

GitHub (for documentation and version control).
